# Alien Invasion Game

This game is based upon the Space Invader arcade game.

## History of Development

I coded this game following the chapters from *Python Crash Course,
2nd Edition* by Eric Matthes.

I then refactored it to implement a Model, View, Controller design pattern.

## Installation

1) clone the repo.
2) create your virtual environment with poetry or with pip via requirement.txt file.
3) run app.py from the virtual environment.
